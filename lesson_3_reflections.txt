When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This could be useful for when you arecollaborating with others, who would want to access
the files from wherever they are. It could also serve as a backup, in case your machine
was is stolen, broken or in incapacitized in any way.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with someone, it might not be a great idea to automatically pull
their work onto your machine. Rather, deciding when to pull after having talked things
through with your collaborators would probably be a wiser choice.
