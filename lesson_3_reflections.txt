When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This could be useful for when you arecollaborating with others, who would want to access
the files from wherever they are. It could also serve as a backup, in case your machine
was is stolen, broken or in incapacitized in any way.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with someone, it might not be a great idea to automatically pull
their work onto your machine. Rather, deciding when to pull after having talked things
through with your collaborators would probably be a wiser choice.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
 instead of another?

A clone is a copy of a repository, either from a remote location (like GitHub) or from
 your own computer. This can used to work on a new version of something without creating
  a branch, or just because you want a copy of it for some other reason.
A Branch is a new section of a repository that diverges from the master branch. This could
 be for trying out new features, changing the language etc.
A fork is basically a clone, but it only exists on GitHub and for you to work on the fork on
your own machine, you need to clone the fork that you have created on GitHub.
