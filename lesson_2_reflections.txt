What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created. This is neccessary, if I want to start using git
 for files in the current directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area might not be directly linked to the computer, in the way
 that the directory is. That is to say, that the staging area is in a
 directory. The repository is where things from the working directory go,
 via the staging area.
